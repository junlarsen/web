              <Text>
                I'm a developer and student based in Trondheim, Norway with a passion for building things that people
                love. I love to explore new things, work on free open-source software, and cook food.

              <Text>
                I'm currently enrolled in a bachelor's degree in informatics at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway. On the side
                I'm remotely working part-time as a frontend developer and working on a number of open-source projects
                on GitHub.
