                I'm a developer, student, and coffee addict based in Trondheim, Norway with a passion for building
                things that people love. I love to explore new things, meet new people, work on open-source software,
                and cook food!

              <Text>
                I'm currently enrolled in a bachelor's degree in informatics at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway. Additionally,
                I work remotely part-time as a frontend developer, routinely working on a number of open-source projects
                on GitHub.

              I'm a firm believer in open-source software, and I consequently find myself spending a lot of time working
              on free, open-source projects on GitHub. Some of the projects I work on were created by me, most by
              others. Here are the ones I've poured the most love into.
